# hybridGeneralAi
HybridGeneralAi is hybrid General artificial intelligence.the really general AI we can get,touch and use.the world's first popular AI form.and it is open source.  

This document Describe a general part of HybridGeneralAi's Description.The version of Description is v0.0.0.1 .  

This is a project,but not only a repository.  
One of The purposes of this Project is to get some progress to the development of whole humanbeing.  

This project start at 2018,within a branch of theRotten organization's.this repository create at 2020.  
This project is a global work,This repository is in multiple languages,and the main language is English,Chinese and Russian.Every publish of the new update will be published in one of the main Languages,and be translated into other languages(include the Document,Annotation,media Description and code explanation etc).  


This project could be built in a way like the initial project of the bitcoin.  


One of this project's aim is to give an easy-to-use artificial intelligence object to everybody who own an ordinary computer or smartphone etc.This AI object is almost free,and it is the real useful AI.It can run in pure-software form,and in with-Real-object form.  

HGAI can be built in parts,modularized,systemized and step by step.HGAI project can be engineered.  

Here is some detail Characteristics of the hybridGeneralAI(HGAI):  

(Details of Effect performance:)  
HGAI have memories,HGAI know what it have experienced.  
HGAI know what it can do,what knowledge it have get,what the knowledge definitely is.HGAI can also show and teach its knowledge to people.  
HGAI object can communicate with another HGAI object and a lot of HGAI objects.  
HGAI object have common memory and personal memory of own object.  
Ordinary People can teach HGAI in clear and simple way,they can directly teach their experience to HGAI,the teacher do not need to know how to code program,they do not need to "Train and regulate the model".  
HGAI can easily implement or Proform people's request and order by itself.such as work within pure softwore and real actuality.  
HGAI can think by itself.  
HGAI can recode and update itself in people-known express form,the code of itself which itself recode is Human kindly,easily to read and easily to understand.  
Multiple HGAI objects can work on one common goal and get co-operations.  
HGAI can run individually.  

(Details of Technical details:)  
HGAI have Definitely description method and Fuzzy perception method of thing Description way.HGAI is Hybrid,Different AI methods can combine in HGAI.  
HGAI can store part of its memory in database but not only in files.  
HGAI can run in cloud,include part of its memory and its form.Multiple HGAI objects can run in one server,one HGAI objects can also run in Mutiple servers.  
HGAI can run in pure offline's local environment,it can be open in a program and close.  
HGAI object have visual object and voice of it own,HGAI have its own Vision and hearing,HGAI can communicate with people in natural language.  
One HGAI object can work on mutiple missions,One HGAI object can implement mutiple works.  
HGAI is not specific used,HGAI is general used.  
HGAI is compatible in Multiple Main stream operating System,such as Windows,Linux,ios and Android etc.  
HGAI can be formed into Saas.  
Part of HGAI system's visual content support main stream explorers' javascript Render.
Part of HGAI's Knowledge can be Describe,Shown and learned,Mastered or Updated in the way of Knowledge Graphs including input,output and description.
